        We are no stranger to the day to day struggle in life! <br></br>
        Like many of you, we hit a wall and felt consumed by the hopeless
        struggle.<br></br>
        There are 2 things that have always helped us get through the hard
        times: <br></br>
        the gym and each other. We have shared a motivation and drive to push{" "}
        <br></br>
        ourselves and each other to strive for our best each day. <br></br>
        Despite what have often times felt like hopeless situations, <br></br>we
        come together to make gains in the gym and in our personal lives.{" "}
        <br></br>
        We build ourselves and each other up in every sense of the <br></br>
        word. We developed resiliency and a bond that can not be broken.{" "}
        <br></br>
        This is how hopeless gains was created, this is our origin.{" "}
