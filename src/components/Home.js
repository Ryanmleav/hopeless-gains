      {/* <br></br> */}
      Like many of you, we hit a wall in a hopeless struggle<br></br>
      {/* <br></br> */}
      in our jobs, careers & life. Different types for each of us<br></br>
      {/* <br></br> */}
      2 things that always helped was one another & the gym. <br></br>
      {/* <br></br> */}
      The gym is always a stress relief but it was the motivation, <br></br>
      {/* <br></br> */}
      the drive we gave eachother & the resilience to push on<br></br>
      {/* <br></br> */}
      despite our hopeless situations that we've come together<br></br>
      {/* <br></br> */}
      to gain more in life.<br></br>
      {/* <br></br> */}
      This is how Hopeless Gains was started!</p>
